# Kart Services — Design Record Index

One folder per BRD service (`docs/services/<name>/`). This is the compiled index — it links out, it doesn't restate. Open a service's own folder to read its actual requirements, edge cases, and (once run) architecture/DDD/contracts/tickets.

Every doc's frontmatter carries its own `status` (`pending-approval` / `approved`) — check that before treating anything below as settled. `pending-approval` means drafted, not reviewed. The table below also uses `⚠️ NEEDS-WORK` for docs that were reviewed against a professional-grade bar and found to have concrete gaps — frontmatter for those still reads `pending-approval` (unchanged) until the gaps are addressed and the doc is re-reviewed.

## What each document type is

- **`requirement-spec.md`** — one service's structured requirements, extracted from the BRD by `requirement-agent`: scope, functional/non-functional requirements, domain invariants, starting API surface, and open questions where the BRD is silent or contradicts itself. See `agent-reusables/agents/requirement-agent.md` for the exact contract.
- **`edge-cases.md`** — bullet-only catalogue of that service's real domain edge cases, produced by `edge-case-analyzer-agent` from its *approved* requirement spec: what happens, why, solution options, and the decision taken (3-5 bullets, chosen + why). See `agent-reusables/agents/edge-case-analyzer-agent.md`.
- **`architecture.md`**, **`ddd-model.md`**, **`api-contract.yaml`**, **`database-design.md`**, **`event-contract.md`**, **`tickets.md`** — later pipeline stages, produced once the two docs above are approved. See `agent-reusables/workflows/new-service.workflow.yaml` for the full DAG.

## Cross-service BRD contradictions — RESOLVED

These came up while drafting the 17 new requirement-specs and the subsequent professional-grade review pass. All are now resolved via ADR in `docs/adr/`, and `kart-requirements.md` (both here and in the source `kart-requirements` repo) has been updated to reflect each resolution directly — these are no longer open questions at the BRD level:

- **Order ↔ Shipping integration direction** — resolved async, end to end. [ADR-0002](../adr/0002-order-shipping-async-integration.md).
- **Notification's actual consumed-event set** — resolved to all `order.*`/`payment.*` routed events plus a few explicitly-named alert events. [ADR-0003](../adr/0003-notification-consumed-event-scope.md).
- **Analytics' actual ingestion scope** — resolved to full fan-in (every published event). [ADR-0004](../adr/0004-analytics-full-fanin-ingestion.md).
- **`OrderCompleted` (Recommendation) and `OrderDelivered` (Review) missing publishers** — unified into one new event, `OrderDelivered`, published by Order. [ADR-0005](../adr/0005-unify-order-terminal-event.md).
- **Identity ↔ User data ownership** — resolved via a new `UserAccountUpdated` event, published by Identity, consumed by User. [ADR-0006](../adr/0006-identity-user-profile-sync-event.md).
- **`InventoryReleased`, `InventoryReplenished`, `RefundIssued`, `CartCheckedOut`, `WishlistPriceAlertTriggered`, `AdminActionPerformed`, `UserRegistered`, `SessionCreated` missing from the Event Catalog** — all eight now have a full row (consumers + retry/DLQ tier) in §10. [ADR-0007](../adr/0007-event-catalog-completeness.md).

**Still outstanding — not a BRD contradiction, but not yet propagated:** `kart-identity-service`, `kart-admin-service`, `kart-order-service`, and `kart-recommendation-service`'s own `requirement-spec.md`/`edge-cases.md` were drafted *before* these ADRs and still describe the old open questions rather than citing the resolutions. Each needs a re-draft pass (cite the relevant ADR, adopt its decision, remove the now-stale open question) before re-review — see the gap table below.

Full detail and citations for the original contradictions are preserved in each ADR's Context section.

## Professional-grade review pass (this round)

Reviewed against a bar of: functional coverage matches the BRD's actual scope for that service, relevant NFRs/invariants are addressed, BRD ambiguities are explicitly flagged rather than silently resolved, and edge cases are genuine domain scenarios (not a generic checklist) each with options considered + a chosen decision + rationale. 9 of 18 reviewed doc-pairs passed and are now `status: approved`; 9 have concrete, named gaps and remain `pending-approval`:

| Service | Gap |
|---|---|
| `kart-identity-service` | Spec/edge-cases predate BRD §24.1/§24.2 (SSO + RBAC issuance) — missing FRs and edge cases for both; Identity↔User event-sync gap not flagged |
| `kart-product-service` | Missing edge cases: discontinued/orphaned variant handling; price change racing an in-progress cart/checkout |
| `kart-inventory-service` | Missing edge case: replenishment racing an active reservation; TTL-firing-while-payment-is-merely-slow under-specified; newly found `InventoryReleased` event gap unflagged |
| `kart-order-service` | Two of three README-tracked contradictions (Order↔Shipping direction, `OrderCompleted` missing publisher) silently resolved/omitted instead of flagged as open questions — disqualifying given this service is the Saga orchestrator |
| `kart-wishlist-service` | Missing edge cases: price rebounds before an alert is delivered; item added to a wishlist after its price already dropped |
| `kart-review-service` | Missing edge cases: duplicate review submission for the same delivered order; moderation-rejection racing an already-updated rating average |
| `kart-delivery-tracking-service` | Missing edge cases: duplicate (not just out-of-order) carrier webhook delivery; unmapped carrier status as its own case; tracking query before the first status event has arrived |
| `kart-admin-service` | RBAC edge cases describe Admin maintaining its own authorization/permission state, conflicting with §24.1's fixed single-issuer (Identity) model |
| `kart-offer-service` (`edge-cases.md` only) | Chosen cache-invalidation strategy contradicts BRD §16's explicit write-through mandate for promotion/pricing flags; missing edge cases for coupon-expiry-racing-checkout and expired-`PricingQuote`-reuse (both already named as hard invariants in this service's own approved `ddd-model.md`) |
